## Code

[dyn_N_occ_simulation_study.R](https://github.com/zipkinlab/Rossman_etal_2016_Ecol/blob/master/Simulation%20Study/dyn_N_occ_simulation_study.R) - Example R and JAGS code used to simulate data, which was then used to estimate parameters (i.e., initial abundance λ, gains γ, survival ω, and detection θ) with the dynamic N-occupancy model.

[simulation_query.R](https://github.com/zipkinlab/Rossman_etal_2016_Ecol/blob/master/Simulation%20Study/simulation_query.R) – Code to load simulation results from git and query results

## Data

[dynNocc_simulation.txt](https://github.com/zipkinlab/Rossman_etal_2016_Ecol/blob/master/Simulation%20Study/dynNocc_simulation.txt) – Results from the full simulation study. Includes “true” parameter estimates used to generate data and estimated parameter results from model.
